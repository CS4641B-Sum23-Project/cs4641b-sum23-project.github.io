                Given three distinct types of images; penguins, turtles, and
                strictly images that are landscapes. We wish to develop an
                algorithm that can distinguish between these three types of
                images. Currently, classification of images is most successful
                when utilizing Deep Learning, or Convolutional Neural Networks
                (CNN) as these models can identify meaningful transformations of
                images for us, rather than hand crafting these transformations
                from the images. Despite these models having remarkable success
                with images where the target is the singular subject. They tend
                to still have difficulties correctly classifying an image if the
                image has a lot of “clutter” or “noise” and can often fall short
                if there are not enough datapoints for the model to work with.

                <p>
                  Our data currently consists of 572 unique images. 500 of these images are used to train the machine learning model,
                  while the rest of the images are reserved for evaluating the trained model’s performance. Our dataset uses discrete 
                  categories to describe the target values, where 0 represents the background, 1 represents the penguins, and 2 represents 
                  the turtles. This indicates that our dataset is discrete.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To ensure that the dataset has no anomalies, we will clean up and normalize the dataset. Our first step will involve 
                  identifying and removing any duplicates, while ensuring that each image is labeled. In addition, to standardize the 
                  data we will make sure that all data is formatted consistently, including file formats and image sizes. To define the 
                  features of our machine learning model, we will use visual characteristics, color distribution and shape descriptors. 
                  Regarding unsupervised learning methods, we are currently evaluating different clustering methods to determine the most 
                  suitable choice. As for supervised learning methods, we are leaning towards using CNNs because it is commonly used for 
                  image classification.

                  Our expected results are to correctly identify an image into one of
                  three categories; those being penguins, turtles or landscape.
                  Additionally, we would like to see our model perform well on any new
                  data introduced to the system, so avoiding overfitting to our current
                  dataset is also a priority.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our chosen metrics for success are accuracy and recall, which can be
                  combined into a single metric, that being F-Measure. This measure
                  considers the overall precision and completeness when evaluating
                  images and would be useful for this project.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Current objectives for the midterm and final respectively are; to be
                  able to distinctly group each of the different image types into
                  clusters, and to have 90%+ accuracy on our supervised learning model.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a midpoint milestone, we will strive to provide analysis on our
                  datasets with different clustering algorithms such as K-Means, DB Scan and GMM
                  clustering evaluation metrics such as the Davies-Bouldin Index and silhouette coefficient. Our
                  final milestone, we will evaluate our clusters with external measures
                  such as the Fowlkes Mallows across the clustering algorithms we use.
                  As well as the accuracy of our model in predicting the correct class
                  of the image, along with false positive, false negative rates.

                  In a conservation context, the differentiation of turtles and penguins
                  has important implications. First, it assists conservationists in
                  differentiating the animals, allowing them to better collect data, and
                  implement strategies for their conservation. Looking at an ecological
                  research perspective, distinguishing between turtles and penguins can
                  provide valuable data to interactions and ecological dynamics.
                  Furthermore, our product can assist in biodiversity monitoring, which
                  leads to a better understanding of the ecosystems' health. In summary,
                  our product has the potential to promote species conservation and
                  enhance our understanding of the targeted animals ecosystem.

                  In our approach, we will initially hand craft features from our
                  dataset, rather than rely on CNNs. However, we will arrive at working
                  with a CNN which will validate the features we have selected or give
                  us information on feature transformations that would be more
                  successful. If our given model is mostly accurate, it will give us
                  confidence that our model can be expanded to more animals. This could
                  be extremely useful in processing images of different animals into
                  distinct groups according to the type of animal.
